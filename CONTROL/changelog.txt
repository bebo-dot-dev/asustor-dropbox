A dropbox API v2 upload/download app originally based on the updown.py script example included in the dropbox python sdk here:
github.com/dropbox/dropbox-sdk-python/tree/master/example/updown.py
This app supports upload/download/sync contents of a given folder with dropbox

v2.4
1) Updated to support Python3

v2.3
1) Log file output cleanup

v2.2
1) Improved dropbox tree traversal / download file unicode exception handling 
2) Fixed the call to files_upload to cope with dropbox introduced breaking change: "File upload endpoints no longer accept file-like objects. Only byte strings are allowed"
3) Fixed existing crontab job detection

v2.1
1) Root path fix to cope with ~/ being interpreted as /root/ on the NAS. / is now accepted as a valid dropbox_folder parameter value

v2.0
1) Implemented the download from dropbox feature. updown.py has been extended to support --u (upload), --d (download), --s (sync (upload + download))

v1.1
1) Improved the post-install.sh shell script to add support for existing cron job detection. The installer will no longer add the cron job to the root crontab file if it's already present

v1.0
1) updown.py has been battle hardened and extended to make it more suited for unattended scheduled operation
2) Supports NAS -> dropbox upload only
3) Has no ADM or web UI whatsoever
4) Implements an internal locking mechanism in /usr/local/AppCentral/community-dropbox-upload/lock to enable execution of multiple concurrent instances of the script for different rootdir source folders
5) Is slow on large dropbox accounts / data stores but is lightweight, will not thrash disks and can be depended on to eventually complete
6) The installer ensures all required python modules are present (pip install six, pip install lockfile, pip install dropbox)
7) The installer by default creates a single cron job containing a placeholder for the required dropbox oauth2 token. Multiple cron jobs can be created to execute the script on any required schedule(s)
8) Logs minimal output to the /usr/local/AppCentral/community-dropbox-upload/log folder
